5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either.

I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus.

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."
5   ,"1. Camera Quality is awesome. Premium lenses with better dynamic range. Very sharp and details produced are phenomenon2. Display us quality is Ahhhh!!! I had never seen a display like this.What a colour reproduction !!!!3. Battery life is comparatively less as it lasts for half day but the good thing is its provided with fast charging supports. It fuels 75% within 1hr4. Dolby atmos sound quality is amazing,provides you with the surround sound expriance like a cinema hall.5. Overall its worth a penny product, I have never dissapointed with it in any aspects"
2   ,"It solves my purpose of 1 Terabyte internal storage - that was a must for me. But its UFS 2.0. The newer phones are coming out with UFS 3.1, but I have not seen any phone till yet with 1 Terabyte of UFS 3.1 internal storage yet - so I'm good.I'm pretty frustrated with its battery life- lasts hardly 4-6 hours with medium power savings mode activated. I cant do maximum power savings mode, because then it turns off all graphic features, and the phone looks like a black brick.Camera is better than my previous Samsung A7, but the newer cameras in newer Samsung phones are mind blowing.This is the last Samsung flagship phone that still has a 3.5mm Jack- so I'm very happy to have bought this.Except for battery life, I think I'm sorted for now...."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options.

That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it.

  The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too.

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
1   ,Phone overheated some time also battery life was not up to mark it only give u 10 hours also gaming performance which Samsung promise they give u very good experience I want say really bad experience hang always when u play pubg also it heated in 30 minutes really worst experience with also when use camera more than 10 minutes it body started heated I request to Amazon to replace after that I use new phone give experience
5   ,"Awesome product by Samsung.Pros:Very Good audio qualityPhone quality is far better than Apple iPhoneScreen quality and size are just amazingHas reachability featureVery good battery lifeVery good cameraMicrosoft integration is awesome0 problem of heatingThe gesture features are awesomeThe edge panel feature is just greatSamsung softwares such as secure folders are goodFace unlock is very consistent.Onscreen fingerprint is good.Cons:Samsung is closing down its cloud. Therefore the syncing is not good.  Contracts are stored in Samsung cloud,  gallery is stored in Microsoft cloud, so it's mess in terms of cloud syncing if you don't want to use Google services due to privacy.Overall the phone is more worth than the money at 52k"

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."
5   ,"1. Camera Quality is awesome. Premium lenses with better dynamic range. Very sharp and details produced are phenomenon2. Display us quality is Ahhhh!!! I had never seen a display like this.What a colour reproduction !!!!3. Battery life is comparatively less as it lasts for half day but the good thing is its provided with fast charging supports. It fuels 75% within 1hr4. Dolby atmos sound quality is amazing,provides you with the surround sound expriance like a cinema hall.5.

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display.

This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration.

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
1   ,Phone overheated some time also battery life was not up to mark it only give u 10 hours also gaming performance which Samsung promise they give u very good experience I want say really bad experience hang always when u play pubg also it heated in 30 minutes really worst experience with also when use camera more than 10 minutes it body started heated I request to Amazon to replace after that I use new phone give experience

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."
5   ,"1. Camera Quality is awesome. Premium lenses with better dynamic range. Very sharp and details produced are phenomenon2. Display us quality is Ahhhh!!! I had never seen a display like this.What a colour reproduction !!!!3. Battery life is comparatively less as it lasts for half day but the good thing is its provided with fast charging supports.

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display.

This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration.

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
1   ,Phone overheated some time also battery life was not up to mark it only give u 10 hours also gaming performance which Samsung promise they give u very good experience I want say really bad experience hang always when u play pubg also it heated in 30 minutes really worst experience with also when use camera more than 10 minutes it body started heated I request to Amazon to replace after that I use new phone give experience

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."
5   ,"1. Camera Quality is awesome. Premium lenses with better dynamic range. Very sharp and details produced are phenomenon2. Display us quality is Ahhhh!!! I had never seen a display like this.What a colour reproduction !!!!3. Battery life is comparatively less as it lasts for half day but the good thing is its provided with fast charging supports. It fuels 75% within 1hr4. Dolby atmos sound quality is amazing,provides you with the surround sound expriance like a cinema hall.5.

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class !

5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7.

  The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too.

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
1   ,Phone overheated some time also battery life was not up to mark it only give u 10 hours also gaming performance which Samsung promise they give u very good experience I want say really bad experience hang always when u play pubg also it heated in 30 minutes really worst experience with also when use camera more than 10 minutes it body started heated I request to Amazon to replace after that I use new phone give experience
5   ,"Awesome product by Samsung.Pros:Very Good audio qualityPhone quality is far better than Apple iPhoneScreen quality and size are just amazingHas reachability featureVery good battery lifeVery good cameraMicrosoft integration is awesome0 problem of heatingThe gesture features are awesomeThe edge panel feature is just greatSamsung softwares such as secure folders are goodFace unlock is very consistent.Onscreen fingerprint is good.Cons:Samsung is closing down its cloud. Therefore the syncing is not good.  Contracts are stored in Samsung cloud,  gallery is stored in Microsoft cloud, so it's mess in terms of cloud syncing if you don't want to use Google services due to privacy.Overall the phone is more worth than the money at 52k"

However hope this can be further extended with software updates down the line by Samsungüòê .One UI 2.5 (current version installed) is pretty neat but i feel it still needs few tweaking in terms of heavy animations used (u can restrict this under Advanced Features). Overall a very good UI, pleasing to eye.Response time & switching between apps has no lag whatsoever, smooth in all aspect.Cell reception is pretty good as compared to my previous phones, so no complaints again.High quality camera with a bulk load of options...üòÉBasically the S10+ an all in one phone with importance given to both performance & features along with a good designWould Highly recommend to others..P.S - Still wondering why Samsung has given a dedicated key for Bixby :), nevertheless you can modify it.."
4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."
5   ,"1. Camera Quality is awesome. Premium lenses with better dynamic range. Very sharp and details produced are phenomenon2. Display us quality is Ahhhh!!! I had never seen a display like this.What a colour reproduction !!!!3. Battery life is comparatively less as it lasts for half day but the good thing is its provided with fast charging supports. It fuels 75% within 1hr4. Dolby atmos sound quality is amazing,provides you with the surround sound expriance like a cinema hall.5. Overall its worth a penny product, I have never dissapointed with it in any aspects"
2   ,"It solves my purpose of 1 Terabyte internal storage - that was a must for me. But its UFS 2.0. The newer phones are coming out with UFS 3.1, but I have not seen any phone till yet with 1 Terabyte of UFS 3.1 internal storage yet - so I'm good.I'm pretty frustrated with its battery life- lasts hardly 4-6 hours with medium power savings mode activated. I cant do maximum power savings mode, because then it turns off all graphic features, and the phone looks like a black brick.Camera is better than my previous Samsung A7, but the newer cameras in newer Samsung phones are mind blowing.This is the last Samsung flagship phone that still has a 3.5mm Jack- so I'm very happy to have bought this.Except for battery life, I think I'm sorted for now...."

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

5   ,"Awesome product by Samsung.Pros:Very Good audio qualityPhone quality is far better than Apple iPhoneScreen quality and size are just amazingHas reachability featureVery good battery lifeVery good cameraMicrosoft integration is awesome0 problem of heatingThe gesture features are awesomeThe edge panel feature is just greatSamsung softwares such as secure folders are goodFace unlock is very consistent.Onscreen fingerprint is good.Cons:Samsung is closing down its cloud. Therefore the syncing is not good.  Contracts are stored in Samsung cloud,  gallery is stored in Microsoft cloud, so it's mess in terms of cloud syncing if you don't want to use Google services due to privacy.Overall the phone is more worth than the money at 52k"

  Phone is Excellent but battery life is not upto the mark

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."
5   ,"1. Camera Quality is awesome. Premium lenses with better dynamic range. Very sharp and details produced are phenomenon2. Display us quality is Ahhhh!!! I had never seen a display like this.What a colour reproduction !!!!3. Battery life is comparatively less as it lasts for half day but the good thing is its provided with fast charging supports. It fuels 75% within 1hr4. Dolby atmos sound quality is amazing,provides you with the surround sound expriance like a cinema hall.5. Overall its worth a penny product, I have never dissapointed with it in any aspects"
2   ,"It solves my purpose of 1 Terabyte internal storage - that was a must for me. But its UFS 2.0. The newer phones are coming out with UFS 3.1, but I have not seen any phone till yet with 1 Terabyte of UFS 3.1 internal storage yet - so I'm good.I'm pretty frustrated with its battery life- lasts hardly 4-6 hours with medium power savings mode activated. I cant do maximum power savings mode, because then it turns off all graphic features, and the phone looks like a black brick.Camera is better than my previous Samsung A7, but the newer cameras in newer Samsung phones are mind blowing.This is the last Samsung flagship phone that still has a 3.5mm Jack- so I'm very happy to have bought this.Except for battery life, I think I'm sorted for now...."

  The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too.

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this.

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display.

This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time.

A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options.

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this.

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."
5   ,"1. Camera Quality is awesome. Premium lenses with better dynamic range. Very sharp and details produced are phenomenon2. Display us quality is Ahhhh!!! I had never seen a display like this.What a colour reproduction !!!!3. Battery life is comparatively less as it lasts for half day but the good thing is its provided with fast charging supports. It fuels 75% within 1hr4. Dolby atmos sound quality is amazing,provides you with the surround sound expriance like a cinema hall.5. Overall its worth a penny product, I have never dissapointed with it in any aspects"
2   ,"It solves my purpose of 1 Terabyte internal storage - that was a must for me. But its UFS 2.0. The newer phones are coming out with UFS 3.1, but I have not seen any phone till yet with 1 Terabyte of UFS 3.1 internal storage yet - so I'm good.I'm pretty frustrated with its battery life- lasts hardly 4-6 hours with medium power savings mode activated. I cant do maximum power savings mode, because then it turns off all graphic features, and the phone looks like a black brick.Camera is better than my previous Samsung A7, but the newer cameras in newer Samsung phones are mind blowing.This is the last Samsung flagship phone that still has a 3.5mm Jack- so I'm very happy to have bought this.Except for battery life, I think I'm sorted for now...."

  The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too.

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available.

  The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too.

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user !

5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
1   ,Phone overheated some time also battery life was not up to mark it only give u 10 hours also gaming performance which Samsung promise they give u very good experience I want say really bad experience hang always when u play pubg also it heated in 30 minutes really worst experience with also when use camera more than 10 minutes it body started heated I request to Amazon to replace after that I use new phone give experience
5   ,"Awesome product by Samsung.Pros:Very Good audio qualityPhone quality is far better than Apple iPhoneScreen quality and size are just amazingHas reachability featureVery good battery lifeVery good cameraMicrosoft integration is awesome0 problem of heatingThe gesture features are awesomeThe edge panel feature is just greatSamsung softwares such as secure folders are goodFace unlock is very consistent.Onscreen fingerprint is good.Cons:Samsung is closing down its cloud. Therefore the syncing is not good.  Contracts are stored in Samsung cloud,  gallery is stored in Microsoft cloud, so it's mess in terms of cloud syncing if you don't want to use Google services due to privacy.Overall the phone is more worth than the money at 52k"

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."
5   ,"1. Camera Quality is awesome. Premium lenses with better dynamic range. Very sharp and details produced are phenomenon2. Display us quality is Ahhhh!!! I had never seen a display like this.What a colour reproduction !!!!3. Battery life is comparatively less as it lasts for half day but the good thing is its provided with fast charging supports.

Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."
5   ,"1. Camera Quality is awesome. Premium lenses with better dynamic range. Very sharp and details produced are phenomenon2. Display us quality is Ahhhh!!! I had never seen a display like this.What a colour reproduction !!!!3. Battery life is comparatively less as it lasts for half day but the good thing is its provided with fast charging supports. It fuels 75% within 1hr4. Dolby atmos sound quality is amazing,provides you with the surround sound expriance like a cinema hall.5.

I cant do maximum power savings mode, because then it turns off all graphic features, and the phone looks like a black brick.Camera is better than my previous Samsung A7, but the newer cameras in newer Samsung phones are mind blowing.This is the last Samsung flagship phone that still has a 3.5mm Jack- so I'm very happy to have bought this.Except for battery life, I think I'm sorted for now...."
5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss.

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display.

This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time.

A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options.

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this.

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."
5   ,"1. Camera Quality is awesome. Premium lenses with better dynamic range. Very sharp and details produced are phenomenon2. Display us quality is Ahhhh!!! I had never seen a display like this.What a colour reproduction !!!!3. Battery life is comparatively less as it lasts for half day but the good thing is its provided with fast charging supports. It fuels 75% within 1hr4. Dolby atmos sound quality is amazing,provides you with the surround sound expriance like a cinema hall.5. Overall its worth a penny product, I have never dissapointed with it in any aspects"
2   ,"It solves my purpose of 1 Terabyte internal storage - that was a must for me. But its UFS 2.0. The newer phones are coming out with UFS 3.1, but I have not seen any phone till yet with 1 Terabyte of UFS 3.1 internal storage yet - so I'm good.I'm pretty frustrated with its battery life- lasts hardly 4-6 hours with medium power savings mode activated. I cant do maximum power savings mode, because then it turns off all graphic features, and the phone looks like a black brick.Camera is better than my previous Samsung A7, but the newer cameras in newer Samsung phones are mind blowing.This is the last Samsung flagship phone that still has a 3.5mm Jack- so I'm very happy to have bought this.Except for battery life, I think I'm sorted for now...."

5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t.

The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."
5   ,"1. Camera Quality is awesome. Premium lenses with better dynamic range. Very sharp and details produced are phenomenon2. Display us quality is Ahhhh!!! I had never seen a display like this.What a colour reproduction !!!!3. Battery life is comparatively less as it lasts for half day but the good thing is its provided with fast charging supports. It fuels 75% within 1hr4. Dolby atmos sound quality is amazing,provides you with the surround sound expriance like a cinema hall.5. Overall its worth a penny product, I have never dissapointed with it in any aspects"
2   ,"It solves my purpose of 1 Terabyte internal storage - that was a must for me. But its UFS 2.0. The newer phones are coming out with UFS 3.1, but I have not seen any phone till yet with 1 Terabyte of UFS 3.1 internal storage yet - so I'm good.I'm pretty frustrated with its battery life- lasts hardly 4-6 hours with medium power savings mode activated. I cant do maximum power savings mode, because then it turns off all graphic features, and the phone looks like a black brick.Camera is better than my previous Samsung A7, but the newer cameras in newer Samsung phones are mind blowing.This is the last Samsung flagship phone that still has a 3.5mm Jack- so I'm very happy to have bought this.Except for battery life, I think I'm sorted for now...."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display.

Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

4   ,"HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It‚Äôs the best I have used so far and it‚Äôs the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It‚Äôs the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it‚Äôs a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn‚Äôt scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it‚Äôs not affecting the performance by any significant amount it‚Äôs just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don‚Äôt think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."
5   ,"1. Camera Quality is awesome. Premium lenses with better dynamic range. Very sharp and details produced are phenomenon2. Display us quality is Ahhhh!!! I had never seen a display like this.What a colour reproduction !!!!3. Battery life is comparatively less as it lasts for half day but the good thing is its provided with fast charging supports. It fuels 75% within 1hr4. Dolby atmos sound quality is amazing,provides you with the surround sound expriance like a cinema hall.5.

I cant do maximum power savings mode, because then it turns off all graphic features, and the phone looks like a black brick.Camera is better than my previous Samsung A7, but the newer cameras in newer Samsung phones are mind blowing.This is the last Samsung flagship phone that still has a 3.5mm Jack- so I'm very happy to have bought this.Except for battery life, I think I'm sorted for now...."
5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss.

I cant do maximum power savings mode, because then it turns off all graphic features, and the phone looks like a black brick.Camera is better than my previous Samsung A7, but the newer cameras in newer Samsung phones are mind blowing.This is the last Samsung flagship phone that still has a 3.5mm Jack- so I'm very happy to have bought this.Except for battery life, I think I'm sorted for now...."
