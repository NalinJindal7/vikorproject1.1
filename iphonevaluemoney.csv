5  ,"If you are an Android user who wants to move to iOS, then this is the best iPhone you can get without spending unnecessary huge amount on pro versions.I myself would have preferred OLED displays over LCD display on iPhone 11 but I just bought the iPhone 11. Trust me the display is very very good on this phone & with all the same chipset as the pro versions, there's really not much that you are losing.You won't regret this purchase if you want to start using iOS! Everything is very fluid & I like it a lot!! Don't think will be moving to Android in future."
5  ,"After 3 years with iPhone 7 I finally decided to take an upgrade to iPhone 11, and I must say, that itâ€™s totally a value for money! Have been using it continuously since morning, itâ€™s been 5-6 hours of usage and the battery has come down from 100 to 75% only!If youâ€™re looking for a high end and value for money smartphone, this is it!There are a few bugs however, but theyâ€™re iOS bugs whichâ€™ll be sorted soon Iâ€™m sure with upcoming updates!"

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)"

5  ,"If u read the review you will know that there are many bad comments. Am also intrigued by it while buying from Amazon, bought during great india sale with a great value for money. Anyway bought it and very satisfied about it. Donâ€™t always made up your mind from some negative, they might have a complaint but itâ€™s always great to buy products from Amazon.This is my 1st iphone and am very happy about the experience. Used more than a week now, here are my review1. I also got a heating problem but that goes away after insane update2. I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth. U might get to use at first but everything is very simple and ios 14 update is great.4. The battery drains alot at first and also that goes away with the update. It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10. Speaker sound is superb, but am not impressed with the earpods so am still using my Mi bluetooth headset11. Camera sound is annoying, only silent when phone is silent.12. Lastly, i have a great experience of using the phone so am happy that i snub xiaomi, oneplus and samsung in the price range.

Donâ€™t always made up your mind from some negative, they might have a complaint but itâ€™s always great to buy products from Amazon.This is my 1st iphone and am very happy about the experience. Used more than a week now, here are my review1. I also got a heating problem but that goes away after insane update2. I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth. U might get to use at first but everything is very simple and ios 14 update is great.4. The battery drains alot at first and also that goes away with the update. It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10. Speaker sound is superb, but am not impressed with the earpods so am still using my Mi bluetooth headset11. Camera sound is annoying, only silent when phone is silent.12.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)"

Anyway bought it and very satisfied about it. Donâ€™t always made up your mind from some negative, they might have a complaint but itâ€™s always great to buy products from Amazon.This is my 1st iphone and am very happy about the experience. Used more than a week now, here are my review1. I also got a heating problem but that goes away after insane update2. I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth. U might get to use at first but everything is very simple and ios 14 update is great.4. The battery drains alot at first and also that goes away with the update. It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10. Speaker sound is superb, but am not impressed with the earpods so am still using my Mi bluetooth headset11. Camera sound is annoying, only silent when phone is silent.12.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth.

It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth.

It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth.

It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth.

It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)"

Anyway bought it and very satisfied about it. Donâ€™t always made up your mind from some negative, they might have a complaint but itâ€™s always great to buy products from Amazon.This is my 1st iphone and am very happy about the experience. Used more than a week now, here are my review1. I also got a heating problem but that goes away after insane update2. I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth. U might get to use at first but everything is very simple and ios 14 update is great.4. The battery drains alot at first and also that goes away with the update. It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10. Speaker sound is superb, but am not impressed with the earpods so am still using my Mi bluetooth headset11. Camera sound is annoying, only silent when phone is silent.12.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth.

It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth.

It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth.

It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth.

It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth.

It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth.

It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth.

It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So thatâ€™s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10. Speaker sound is superb, but am not impressed with the earpods so am still using my Mi bluetooth headset11. Camera sound is annoying, only silent when phone is silent.12. Lastly, i have a great experience of using the phone so am happy that i snub xiaomi, oneplus and samsung in the price range. But it takes a lot of time jumping from android to ios, so it will always be a personal choice"
4  ,"At first I was sceptical about my purchase because I was shifting from Android to iOS but down the line this started to amaze me with most of the things.FEW THINGS worth mentioning are:Cons1.

5  ,"If you are an Android user who wants to move to iOS, then this is the best iPhone you can get without spending unnecessary huge amount on pro versions.I myself would have preferred OLED displays over LCD display on iPhone 11 but I just bought the iPhone 11. Trust me the display is very very good on this phone & with all the same chipset as the pro versions, there's really not much that you are losing.You won't regret this purchase if you want to start using iOS! Everything is very fluid & I like it a lot!! Don't think will be moving to Android in future."
5  ,"After 3 years with iPhone 7 I finally decided to take an upgrade to iPhone 11, and I must say, that itâ€™s totally a value for money! Have been using it continuously since morning, itâ€™s been 5-6 hours of usage and the battery has come down from 100 to 75% only!If youâ€™re looking for a high end and value for money smartphone, this is it!There are a few bugs however, but theyâ€™re iOS bugs whichâ€™ll be sorted soon Iâ€™m sure with upcoming updates!"

  Awesome phone!! Specially if youâ€™re upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4  ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didnâ€™t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and wonâ€™t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care canâ€™t connect with a person and their automated options doesnâ€™t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

4  ,"Great iphone if you are looking for long term usage and durability, excellent cameras and performanceThe only con at this price is the charger provided is only 5 Watt takes a long time to charge even though the battery is small comparatively.If you are on budget and want to buy apple its the best value for money optionDisplay is still very good many people wont miss the oled from the pros."
3  ,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)"
4  ,"Read a lot of negative reviews regarding buying iphone 11 from amazon but somehow gathered a lot of courage and went forward. Got it for 45k with all the bank offers and this seems to value for money.HEATING ISSUESYou will read a lot of reviews about heating issues. Yes there is some heating issue but that went away after i updated it to ios14 and minor tweaks here and there.BATTERY LIFEI am not a very heavy user so it runs me for about 1.5 days, it would vary upon usage but it would last you for one entire day for sureBACK CAMERAI loved it but am quite disappointed with the front cameraOPERATING SYSTEMIos really makes life so so easy there are so many small small features that apple might not market about but it makes your life so so easy. Its experience is way better than android. I was myself a stock android user but seeing the flexibility with ios, you might not ever switch back"
5  ,"If u read the review you will know that there are many bad comments. Am also intrigued by it while buying from Amazon, bought during great india sale with a great value for money. Anyway bought it and very satisfied about it. Donâ€™t always made up your mind from some negative, they might have a complaint but itâ€™s always great to buy products from Amazon.This is my 1st iphone and am very happy about the experience. Used more than a week now, here are my review1. I also got a heating problem but that goes away after insane update2. I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth. U might get to use at first but everything is very simple and ios 14 update is great.4. The battery drains alot at first and also that goes away with the update. It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it â‚¹1500 to â‚¹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there.
