5   ,"Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.
5   ,"1.Do not remove the pre applied screen protector. It doesn't come in the way of the fingerprint sensor.2.Battery is ok. Basic to medium usage at least one and half days.3.Camera cutout can be removed like the ""remove notch"" option in one plus.4.if your hands are small you will still love this phone. Main reason is the screen size to view videos or games.5.if you play games like clash of kings or pubg the battery will last a few hours. As on any other similar segment phone.6.has live message / ar emojis7.company provided back case is best if you want to keep it light.(Hard plastic clear case)8.white colored akg headset with the box accessories.  Good for basic calling and music.9. Bixby button can be reassigned to another app.10. Camera quality is very nice. Both front and back.11. Hybrid slot for two sims or one sim and one memory card.12. The 5g doesn't have second sim option and no hrm sensor. So choose between the two."

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.
5   ,"1.Do not remove the pre applied screen protector. It doesn't come in the way of the fingerprint sensor.2.Battery is ok.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

Basic to medium usage at least one and half days.3.Camera cutout can be removed like the ""remove notch"" option in one plus.4.if your hands are small you will still love this phone.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

Basic to medium usage at least one and half days.3.Camera cutout can be removed like the ""remove notch"" option in one plus.4.if your hands are small you will still love this phone.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.
5   ,"1.Do not remove the pre applied screen protector. It doesn't come in the way of the fingerprint sensor.2.Battery is ok. Basic to medium usage at least one and half days.3.Camera cutout can be removed like the ""remove notch"" option in one plus.4.if your hands are small you will still love this phone.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

Basic to medium usage at least one and half days.3.Camera cutout can be removed like the ""remove notch"" option in one plus.4.if your hands are small you will still love this phone.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

Basic to medium usage at least one and half days.3.Camera cutout can be removed like the ""remove notch"" option in one plus.4.if your hands are small you will still love this phone.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."

Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"
5   ,"I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."
5   ,This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

5   ,"Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."
5   ,"S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."
