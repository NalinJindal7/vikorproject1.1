4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."

5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately.

Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."
4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras.

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"

However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."
4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone.

As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."

5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

But this price range I would suggest you to order iPhone 11. Its really a great deal.And if u r a long time iPhone user . Then this will be really great for you.Got for it Guys !!!"
4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH.

5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."
4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

But this price range I would suggest you to order iPhone 11. Its really a great deal.And if u r a long time iPhone user . Then this will be really great for you.Got for it Guys !!!"
4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine.

Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow.

Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%.

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone.

Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."

5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%!

Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

But this price range I would suggest you to order iPhone 11. Its really a great deal.And if u r a long time iPhone user . Then this will be really great for you.Got for it Guys !!!"
4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%.

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone.

Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."

5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%!

Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

But this price range I would suggest you to order iPhone 11. Its really a great deal.And if u r a long time iPhone user . Then this will be really great for you.Got for it Guys !!!"
4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%.

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
5 ,Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

4 ,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone.

Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."

5 ,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

4 ,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
3 ,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4 ,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."
